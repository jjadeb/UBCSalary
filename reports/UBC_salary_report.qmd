## Aim

This document explores The University of British Columbia (UBC) faculty salaries based on guessed gender.

## Data

Salary data was sourced from @salary_data. To access individual financial reports, click on the yearly links under the header `Statement of Financial Information (SOFI)`.

Gender data was inferred using first names of staff members. In order to guess gender, I used baby name datasets [@canadian_babyname; @american_babyname; @indian_babyname].

## Ethics

In this project first names are used to guess whether someone is "male" or "female". Many people do not fit into these categories. Misgendering, or incorrectly assigning gender to individuals, can have harmful effects. In addition, while first names can sometimes be an indication of someones gender, first names are not inherintly gendered. 

I encourage anyone who notices a misgendering within this project to raise an issue in the issues tab, and it will be corrected. In addition, I encourage respectful and inclusive language in all discussions related to gender. 

**Due to the low level of accuracy in gender predicion of this report, any conlusions drawn are not meaningful.**


## Methods

The Python programming language [@Python] was used to perform this analysis.

### Data collection

As mentioned earlier, for UBC salary data, I used the salary PDFs that UBC releases every year [@salary_data]. The following steps were taken to collect the data.

- Use the `requests` package to access the UBC Financial Reports [webpage](https://finance.ubc.ca/reporting-planning-analysis/reports-and-disclosures).
- Extract all links and filter for the Statement of Financial Information (SOFI) PDF links which contain salary information.
- If there are any PDFs from which I have not already collected salary data, extract the text from the PDF using the package `pypdf`.
- Store the new salary data

An exerpt of the raw salary data is below.

```{python}
  with open("../data/salary_data/raw_salary_data.pickle", "rb") as raw_salary_dict:
        raw_salary_text_data = pickle.load(raw_salary_dict)

print(raw_salary_text_data["2020"][200210:200300])
```


### Data cleaning

In this section, the following steps are taken to clean the salary data:

For each year of salary data,

- Remove special charachters from text. For example, ş.
- Remove unnecessary text content. For example, the "[Auditor's] Qualified Opinion".
- Uses regex to process the raw text data into a structured DataFrame with columns: `Name`, `Remuneration`, `Expenses`.
- Split the `Name` column into first and last names. 
- Convert salary (remuneration) and expenses columns to a numeric data type.
- Shorten first and last names to allow for easier name matching between years. For example, someone's name in 2020 could be "Bob M Sherbert" and in 2021 their name could be "Bob-M Sherbert". This name would be shortened to Bob Sherbert to avoid mismatching.

Then, I concatenate dataframes from all years together.

@tbl-cleandata shows an expert of the cleaned salary data.
```{python}
#| label: tbl-cleandata
#| tbl-cap: Clean UBC Salary Data
clean_salary_data = pd.read_csv("../data/salary_data/clean_salary_data/all_clean_salary_data.csv")
clean_salary_data.head()
```

## Gender Prediction 

### Babyname Corpus
In order to predict gender, I used datasets with babynames and assigned genders. In order to have a somewhat diverse set of baby names, I used babynames from Canadian, American, and Indian sources [@canadian_babyname, @american_babyname, @indian_babyname].

For each UBC staff name, I found whether that name was more common among girls or boys in the babyname dataset. Then, I guessed the gender that was most common.

In @tbl-babynames, the `Accuracy` column shows the percentage of gender majority from the babyname dataset. For example, if 95% of babys named George in the dataset were male, the `Accuracy` column value would be 0.95. Any staff names that had less than an 80% gender majority were given a null gender.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-babynames
#| tbl-cap: Babyname Data
clean_babynames = pd.read_csv("../data/gender_corpus/clean_name_corpus.csv")
low_accuracy_df = clean_babynames.sort_values(by="Accuracy").head(1)
low_accuracy_name = low_accuracy_df.iloc[0]["First_Name"]
low_accuracy_value = low_accuracy_df.iloc[0]["Accuracy"]
low_accuracy_df
```

We can see the name `{python} low_accuracy_name` has about the same number of boy and girl names. This name has an accuracy of `{python} low_accuracy_value`. So, since its not above the 80% threshold, anyone with that name would have a gender value of `None` assigned.

```{python}
corpus_predictions = pd.read_csv("../data/gender_predictions/corpus_gender_predictions.csv")
non_corpus_data = pd.read_csv("../data/gender_predictions/needs_gender_predictions.csv")
matched_percentage = round(100*corpus_predictions.shape[0]/(corpus_predictions.shape[0] + non_corpus_data.shape[0]),2)
```

Around `{python} matched_percentage`% of UBC staff names were able to be matched with names in the babyname dataset.

### NLTK

For UBC staff names that were not found in the babyname datasets, I used a natural language processing model (package: `nltk`) to predict gender. 

Below are some examples of names not found in the babyname dataset.

```{python}
nltk_predictions_needed = pd.read_csv("../data/gender_predictions/needs_gender_predictions.csv")
nltk_predictions_needed.head(5)["First_Name"]
```

In order to train and evaluate the model, the babyname dataset was split into a trianing and test set. The accuracy on the test set was `0.85`. However, the accuracy on the actual data is likely lower than `0.85` since the actual data contains more unique, unusual names that were not found in our babyname dataset. 

The two features the classifier found most useful were the last 3 letters and last 4 letters of a name.

## Exploratory Data Analysis


## Limitations

**Due to the low level of accuracy in gender predicion of this report, conlusions drawn are not meaningful.**

- nltk training data not representative of real data
- no practical way to check ground truths
- etc.
